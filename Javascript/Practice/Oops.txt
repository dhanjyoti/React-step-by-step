4 pillers of Oops-

1.  Encapsulation:-
    Encapsulation means wrapping up data & member function(Method) together into 
    a single unit i.e, class.

2.  Abstraction:-
    Abstraction is the process of showing only essential/necessary features of 
    an entity/object to the outside world and hide the other irrelevent information.
                For Example:- to open our TV we only have a power button. It is not 
    required to understand how infra-red waves are getting generated in TV 
    remote control.

3.  Inheritance:- 
    Inheritance allows a class(subclass) to acquire the properties and behaviour of 
    another class(super-class). It helps to reuse, customize and enhance the existing 
    code. So, it helps to write a code accurately and reduce the development time.

4.  Polymorphism:-
    Polymorphism means 'many forms'. A subclass can define its own unique behaviour
    and still share the same functionalities or behaviour of its parent/base class.

    class square(){                     |   class circle(){}
        area();                         |       area();   
    }                                   |   }
                                        |
    Var S1 = new square();              |   Var C1 = new circle();
    S1-> area();                        |   C1-> area();
