1. Everything in JS happens inside an Execution Context.
Divided into 2 components- 1. Memory Component(Variable Environment) 
                            Key as a Value
                           2. Code Component(Thread of Execution)
                            Works line by line

2. Javascript is synchronous single-threaded language. 
means - js can execute only one code of line at a time & in a specific order.

                           2. Program stack
                           3. Control stack
                           4. Runtime stack
