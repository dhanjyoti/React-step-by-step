**Web development** refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.

The word Web Development is made up of two words, that is:
* Web: It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over the internet.
* Development: It refers to building the application from scratch.

Web Development can be classified into two ways:
* Frontend Development
* Backend Development

* Frontend Development - The part of a website where the user interacts directly is termed as front end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application.

    * HTML: HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design the front end portion of web pages using markup language. It acts as a skeleton for a website since it is used to make the structure of a website.
    * CSS: Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It is used to style our website.
    * JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language used to provide a dynamic behavior to our website.
    It is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive(eg - having complex animations, clickable buttons, pop-up menus, etc.). 
    It is also synchronous single-threaded language, meaning JavaScript can execute only one code of line at a time and in a specific order.

* Backend Development - Backend is the server side of a website. It is part of the website that users cannot see and interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. It is used to store and arrange data.
