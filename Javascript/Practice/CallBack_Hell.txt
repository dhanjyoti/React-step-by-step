While writing callback we face two issues-
    # Callback Hell
    # Inversion Of Control

Callback-Hell-> When we have a large code base, & too many functions here and there 
    & one function is dependent on the other, we end up falling into callback-hell. 
    Here our code starts to grow horizontally instead of vertically. It is very 
    unmaintainable. It is also known as `Pyramid of Doom`.

Inversion Of Control-> It is another problem while using callback, it is like we 
    loose the control of our code when we are using callbacks.
