### HTML ###

1. What is a DOM ?

->  The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. 
    It represents the structure of an HTMtL or XML document as a tree of objects, 
    and it allows scripts to interact with and manipulate the content and 
    structure of a webpage dynamically.

example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>DOM Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="mainTitle">Hello, DOM!</h1>
    <p id="demo">This is a simple webpage.</p>

    <script>
        // Accessing elements in the DOM
        var titleElement = document.getElementById("mainTitle");
        var demoElement = document.getElementById("demo");

        // Modifying content
        titleElement.textContent = "Welcome to the DOM!";
        demoElement.innerHTML = "This content has been updated.";

        // Creating a new element and appending it to the body
        var newParagraph = document.createElement("p");
        newParagraph.textContent = "This is a new paragraph.";
        document.body.appendChild(newParagraph);
    </script>
</body>
</html>

2. What is a difference between div and span ?

-> 1. `div` is a block-level container. 
                But `span` is inline-level container.
    2. `div` is typically used to group and structure content, creating a block-level 
        container that often separates sections of a webpage.
                But `span` is used to apply styles or scripting to a specific 
                portion of text within a block-level element.
    3. `div` is usually starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.
                But `span` does not start on a new line and only takes up as much 
                width as necessary.
___________________________________________________________________________________

3. Can I have a multiple element with same ID. If No then Why ?

-> No, according to the HTML specification, IDs (identifiers) must be unique within 
    a page. Each element should have a unique ID to ensure that the document's 
    structure and elements can be reliably accessed and manipulated using 
    JavaScript and CSS.

    Having multiple elements with the same ID is considered invalid HTML and can 
    lead to unexpected behavior in scripts and styles. When we attempt to select 
    an element by its ID using JavaScript, the browser will typically return only 
    the first element with that ID, ignoring subsequent elements with the same ID.

                To uniquely identify and work with multiple elements, use classes 
    instead of IDs. Classes can be applied to multiple elements, and we can select 
    and manipulate them collectively or individually using JavaScript or CSS.
___________________________________________________________________________________

4. How do you specify a MetaData in HTML?

-> In HTML, metadata is often specified using the `<meta>` element, which provides 
    information about the HTML document. The `<meta>` element is placed within the 
    `<head>` section of the HTML document. 

    Example: 1. Character Set Encoding (UTF-8)
            2.  Viewport Configuration (for Responsive Design)
            3.  Setting the Page Title
            4.  Description and Keywords (for Search Engines)
            5.  Setting the Author and Copyright
            6.  Preventing Page Indexing by Search Engines
___________________________________________________________________________________

5. What is difference between document & Window object.

-> 1. The `window` object represents the browser window or the global context for 
        JavaScript execution.
                    But the `document` object represents the HTML document loaded in 
        the browser window.

    2.  `window` is the top-level object in the browser's hierarchy and serves as 
        the global object for JavaScript in a web page.
                    But `document` is a property of the window object and provides 
        an interface to interact with the content and structure of the document.

    3.  Properties and methods associated with the `window` object include things 
        like 'document', 'location', 'console', 'alert', and 'setTimeout'.
                    But properties and methods associated with the `document` object 
        include things like 'getElementById', 'querySelector', 'createElement', and 
        others used for DOM manipulation.
___________________________________________________________________________________

### CSS ###

1. What is Box Model ?

-> The Box Model in CSS is a fundamental concept that describes how elements on a 
web page are rendered and how their dimensions are calculated. It conceptualizes 
an HTML element as a rectangular box with four main components:

Content:
    The actual content of the element, such as text, images, or other media.
    It is defined by the width and height properties.

Padding:
    The transparent area around the content inside the element.
    Padding is specified using the padding property and its individual 
    components like padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left.

Border:
    The boundary around the padding, separating the content from the next layer.
    The border is specified using the border property and its individual 
    components like border-width, border-style, and border-color.

Margin:
    The transparent area outside the border, creating space between the element 
    and its surrounding elements.
    Margin is specified using the margin property and its individual components 
    like margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left.

2. What are the advantages of using CSS?

-> 1. It gives styling to the website, which makes the website look more beautiful.
    2. It makes our app responsive, making it usable in desktop, tab and mobile.
    3. We can provide animation and transition in our app making it more dynamic.

-> 1. Separation of Concerns:
        CSS separates the structure (HTML) and presentation (styling) of a web page. 
        This separation makes the code more modular, maintainable, and easier to 
        understand.

    Consistent Styling:
        CSS allows us to define styles in a central location and apply them 
        consistently across multiple pages. This ensures a cohesive and professional 
        look for the entire website.

    Easy Maintenance:
        Centralized styling makes it easier to update the look and feel of a website. 
        Changes to the design can be made in the CSS file without altering the HTML 
        structure.

    Responsive Design:
        CSS provides features like media queries and flexible layout options, 
        enabling the creation of responsive designs that adapt to different screen 
        sizes and devices.

    Reusability of Code:
        CSS classes and styles can be reused across different elements, reducing 
        redundancy and promoting a more efficient coding process.

    Improved Page Load Times:
        External CSS files can be cached by the browser, resulting in faster page 
        load times for subsequent visits to the site.

    Accessibility:
        CSS allows for the creation of accessible designs, making it easier to 
        implement features like proper heading structures, text alternatives for 
        images, and improved navigation for users with disabilities.

    Browser Compatibility:
        CSS helps in achieving a consistent appearance across different web 
        browsers. It provides ways to handle browser-specific issues and 
        inconsistencies.

    Animation and Transitions:
        CSS supports animations and transitions, allowing developers to create 
        visually engaging effects without relying on JavaScript or Flash.

    Print-Friendly Styles:
        Separate styles for print media can be defined using CSS, ensuring that 
        web pages are readable and presentable when printed.

    Flexibility and Control:
        CSS provides a high level of control over the layout, styling, and 
        positioning of elements on a web page, allowing developers to create 
        intricate designs.

    Maintainable Codebase:
        Well-organized and modular CSS code leads to a more maintainable 
        codebase, making it easier for multiple developers to collaborate on 
        a project.

3. What is diff between Display : none and Visible false.

->  1. When an element is set to `display: none`, it is entirely removed from the 
        document flow.
                    But when an element is set to `visibility: hidden`, it remains 
        in the document flow, but it is not visible.

    2. In `display: none` the element is not rendered, and it doesn't take up any 
        space on the page. 
                    But in `visibility: hidden` the element is still rendered, and 
        it takes up space on the page as if it were visible.
          
    3. In `display: none` child elements of the hidden element are also not rendered.
                    But in `visibility: hidden` child elements of the hidden element 
        are still rendered.

    4. In `display: none` property essentially hides the element and its content, 
        making it as if it doesn't exist on the page
                    But in `visibility: hidden` the property hides the element 
        visually while keeping its position in the layout.
___________________________________________________________________________________

4. What are the different types of Selectors in CSS?

-> 1. Universal Selector (`*`):
        Selects all elements on the page.
        Example: `* { color: blue; }`

    2.Type or Element Selector:
        Selects elements based on their HTML tag.
        Example: `p { font-size: 16px; }`

    3.Class Selector (`.class`):
        Selects elements based on their class attribute.
        Example: `.highlight { background-color: yellow; }`

    4.ID Selector (`#id`):
        Selects a single element based on its unique ID attribute.
        Example: `#header { font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; }`

    5.Child Selector (`>`):
        Selects a direct child element.
        Example: `ul > li { list-style-type: square; }`

    6.Descendant Selector (whitespace):
        Selects an element that is a descendant of another specified element.
        Example: `article p { color: #333; }`

    7.Adjacent Sibling Selector (`+`):
        Selects an element that is directly adjacent to another specified element.
        Example: `h2 + p { font-style: italic; }`

    8.Attribute Selector:
        Selects elements based on the presence or value of their attributes.
        Example: `input[type="text"] { border: 1px solid #ccc; }`

    9.Pseudo-class Selector (`:pseudo-class`):
        Selects elements based on their state or position.
        Example: `a:hover { color: red; }`
    
    10.Pseudo-element Selector (`::pseudo-element`):
        Selects a specific part of an element.
        Example: `p::first-line { font-weight: bold; }`

    11.Grouping Selector:
        Groups multiple selectors to apply the same style to multiple elements.
        Example: `h1, h2, h3 { color: navy; }`
___________________________________________________________________________________

5. Difference between percentage and Pixel?

->  Pixel (px):
        1. Absolute Unit: Pixels are an absolute unit of measurement.
        2. Fixed Size: One pixel is a single dot on a screen, and the size of 
            elements specified in pixels remains constant regardless of the screen 
            size or resolution.
        Example: width: 200px;

    Percentage (%):
        1. Relative Unit: Percentages are relative units that are calculated 
            relative to the size of the parent container.
        2. Responsive: Using percentages allows for more responsive designs, as the 
            size is relative to the container's dimensions.
        Example: width: 50%;
___________________________________________________________________________________

6. What is the difference between logical tag and physical tag ?

-> 1. Logical Tag:
    *   "logical tag" may refer to semantic HTML elements that 
            describe the meaning or purpose of the content they enclose rather than 
            their visual presentation.
    *   Examples of logical tags include <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, 
            <section>, <aside>, <footer>, etc.
    *   Logical tags are designed to convey the structure and purpose of the content, 
            making the HTML more semantically meaningful.

    2. Physical Tag:
    *   "physical tag" might be used to refer to HTML elements that are 
            more presentational and describe how content should be styled or displayed.
    *   Examples of physical tags include <b> (bold), <i> (italic), <u> (underline), 
            <font>, etc.
    *   In modern web development, the use of physical tags is discouraged in favor 
            of CSS for styling, and the emphasis is on using logical, semantic HTML.
___________________________________________________________________________________
->  * Logical Properties and Values:
        Logical Properties: Introduced in modern CSS, logical properties are 
        designed to provide a more abstract and flexible way to describe layout and 
        styling that adapts to different writing modes 
        (e.g., left-to-right or right-to-left).

        Example: Instead of margin-left, you might use margin-inline-start, which 
        represents the start of the inline axis and adapts based on the writing mode.

    * Physical Properties and Values:
        Physical Properties: These are traditional CSS properties that describe 
        layout and styling based on the physical characteristics of the document, 
        such as left, right, top, bottom, margin-left, etc.

        Example: margin-left: 20px;, padding-top: 10px;

### Javascript ###

1. What are the different data types present in JavaScript?

-> Data Type: a data type defines the type of value that a variable or expression 
    can hold.
                    JavaScript provides eight(8) different data types which are 
    undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.
___________________________________________________________________________________

2. Difference between `null` and `undefined`.

->  In JavaScript, null is an assignment value that represents no value or no object. 
    It is an intentional absence of any object value. On the other hand, `undefined` 
    is a type itself and represents a variable that has been declared but has not 
    yet been assigned a value.

Code Examples:

        var nullVar = null;
        console.log(nullVar); // Output: null

        var undefinedVar;
        console.log(undefinedVar); // Output: undefined

Intuition: We can think of null as an explicit "nothing" we can assign to a 
    variable, while undefined is what we get when a variable has been declared 
    without an assigned value.
___________________________________________________________________________________

3. Difference between Let, const & Var.

-> In JavaScript, let, const, and var are used to declare variables. var is 
    function-scoped and has been the traditional way of declaring variables. let and 
    const are block-scoped, and they were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6).

    let allows us to declare a variable that can be reassigned, while const is used 
    to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned.

Code Examples:

        var functionScopedVar = "I am function-scoped!";
        let blockScopedVar = "I am block-scoped!";
        const constantVar = "I am a constant!";

        if (true) {
        var functionScopedVar = "I am still function-scoped!";
        let blockScopedVar = "I am still block-scoped!";
        // const constantVar = "I cannot be reassigned!"; // Would throw an error
        }

        console.log(functionScopedVar); // Output: "I am still function-scoped!"
        console.log(blockScopedVar); // Output: "I am block-scoped!"
        console.log(constantVar); // Output: "I am a constant!"

Intuition: Think of var as a more flexible way of declaring variables that can be 
    accessed within the entire function scope. In contrast, let and const provide 
    better control over variable scope, reducing the chances of bugs caused by 
    unintentional modifications.

1. var is the traditional way of writing Javascript variable.
    But, let & const are the latest version of writing javascript variable, 
    introduced in ECMAScript 2015(ES6);

2. var is a functional scoped, But let & const are block scoped.

3. var can be redeclared and converted to var again.
    let can be declared without assigning any value to it, 
    we can declare value to it later on.

4. let can be converted to const, but const cannot be converted. let can change it's 
    value. But const is constant, which is unchangable and cannot change it's value.

5. We can initialize values to var & let later on, but in const we must initialize value
    immediately.

6. let allows us to declare a variable that can be reassigned, while const is used 
    to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned.

___________________________________________________________________________________

4. Explain Hoisting in JavaScript.

-> Hoisting -> Hoisting is a phenomina in Javascrpt by which we can access variables 
    and functions, even before we initialize it or we have put some value in it.
    We can access the variables without any error.  

Eg: In case of single variable the output will be undefined. 
    In case of proper function declaration it will show us the result. 
    in case of only function name without the paranthesis `()`
    it will show us the whole function code.
    In case the function is an arrow function it will give us
    an error "x is not a function". 

                Hoisting is a mechanism in JavaScript where variable and function 
    declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the 
    compilation phase. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the 
    initializations.

Code Example:

            console.log(hoistedVar); // Output: undefined
            var hoistedVar = "I am hoisted!";

            // Equivalent to:
            sayHello();
            function sayHello(){
                console.log("hello");
            }                           // Output: hello
___________________________________________________________________________________

5. Explain Implicit Type Coercion in javascript.

-> Implicit type coercion in JavaScript refers to the automatic conversion of one 
    data type to another without the explicit involvement of the programmer. This 
    behavior occurs during certain operations or comparisons involving different 
    data types. JavaScript attempts to make sense of the operation by converting 
    one or more values to a common type.

Here are some examples of implicit type coercion:

    String and Number Concatenation: 
        var result = "5" + 3; // Result is the string "53"

        In this example, the number `3` is implicitly coerced into a string and 
        concatenated with the string `"5"`.

    Number and Boolean Operations:
        var result = 5 - true; // Result is the number 4

        The boolean value `true` is implicitly coerced to the number `1` during the 
        subtraction operation.

    Comparison Operators:
        var result = "10" > 5; // Result is true

        The string `"10"` is implicitly coerced to the number `10` during the 
        greater-than comparison.

    Falsy and Truthy Values:
        var result = "Hello" || "World"; // Result is "Hello"

        The logical OR (`||`) operator returns the first truthy value. If the left 
        operand is truthy, it is returned; otherwise, the right operand is returned. 
        Here, the string `"Hello"` is truthy, so it is returned.

While implicit type coercion can be convenient, it's important for developers to be 
aware of its behavior to prevent unexpected results. Explicit type conversion using 
functions like `parseInt`, `parseFloat`, `Number()`, `String()`, etc., can be used 
when more control over the conversion process is needed.
___________________________________________________________________________________

6. Explain passed by value and passed by reference.

-> In programming, the terms "passed by value" and "passed by reference" refer to 
    how arguments are transferred to functions and methods. These concepts are 
    crucial in understanding how data is manipulated in a programming language.

    1. Passed by Value:
    -> Pass by value means when a variable is assigned to another variable, the value stored 
        in the variable is copied into the new variable. They are independent of each other, 
        each occupying its own memory space.

    * In a "passed by value" mechanism, the actual value of the variable is passed 
        to the function or method.
    * The function receives a copy of the variable's value, and any changes made to 
        the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable outside 
        the function.
    * This is typical for primitive data types such as numbers, strings, and booleans.

Example (in JavaScript):

                function increment(num) {
                num = num + 1;
                }

                let count = 5;
                increment(count);
                console.log(count); // Output: 5 (unchanged)

    2. Passed by Reference:
    -> When an object is created in JavaScript, it is stored in a memory space, 
        and the variable associated with it stores the memory address or reference 
        where the object is stored.

    * In a "passed by reference" mechanism, the memory address (reference) of the 
        variable is passed to the function or method.
    * Any changes made to the parameter inside the function affect the original 
        variable outside the function because they both point to the same memory 
        location.
    * This is typical for non-primitive data types such as objects and arrays.

Example (in JavaScript):

                function addItem(arr, item) {
                    arr.push(item);
                }

                let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
                addItem(myArray, 4);
                console.log(myArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] (modified)

It's important to note that the terms "passed by value" and "passed by reference" 
are somewhat simplifications, and a more accurate way to describe JavaScript's 
behavior is "passed by value" for primitives and "passed by sharing" or "passed by 
object reference" for objects. In the case of objects, the reference is passed by 
value, meaning changes to the object's properties are visible outside the function, 
but reassigning the reference inside the function does not affect the 
original reference.

//  Difference
1.  Pass by Value works only on Primitive Datatypes.
2.  In pass by value original copy of the data is copied.
3.  The function receives a copy of the variable's value,
    and any changes made to the parameter inside the function 
    do not affect the original variable outside the function.
4.  Example:- 
    let a = 5; 
    let b = a;
    console.log(a);
    console.log(b);
    // Output for both will be 5.
5.  After passing by value the original variable and the copied variable
    both works independently.


1.  Pass by Reference works only on Non-primitive Datatypes.
2.  In pass by reference the memory location is copied 
    or the reference value is copied
3.  Any changes made to the parameter inside the function affect 
    the original variable outside the function because they both 
    point to the same memory location.
4.  Example:-
    let obj1 = {
        name: "dhan",
        pass: "rabha"
    }
    let obj2 = obj1;
    obj2.pass = "dddd";
    console.log(obj1);
    console.log(obj2);
    // Output will change the 'pass' of original variable to "dddd";
5.  After passing by reference the value of the original variable and the
    copied variable is depedent on each other, which means if one changes,
    the other's value might also get changed.
___________________________________________________________________________________

7. What is immediately invoked function?

-> An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is a common JavaScript pattern 
    where a function is defined and executed immediately after its creation. This 
    pattern helps create a private scope for variables, preventing them from 
    polluting the global scope. The syntax involves wrapping the function in 
    parentheses and invoking it immediately.

    Imp:- Prevent Global scope pollution, by not letting the code assible outside 
    the IIFE.

    Here's the basic structure of an IIFE:

                (function() {
                    // code inside this function is executed immediately
                })();

    You can also pass arguments to an IIFE:

                (function(x, y) {
                    console.log(x + y);
                })(3, 5); // Outputs: 8

    Key features of IIFE:
    1. Encapsulation: Variables declared inside the IIFE are not accessible from 
        the outside, providing a way to create private variables.
    2. Avoiding Global Scope Pollution: Since the variables and functions inside 
        the IIFE are not added to the global scope, they don't interfere with 
        other scripts or libraries.
    3. Immediate Execution: The function is executed immediately after it's 
        defined, allowing us to perform tasks or initialize values right away.

8. Explain Higher Order Functions in javascript.

-> Higher-order functions in JavaScript are functions that operate on other 
    functions by taking them as arguments or returning them. In other words, a 
    higher-order function either takes one or more functions as arguments or 
    returns a new function.

    Here are the two main characteristics of higher-order functions:

    1. Takes a Function as an Argument:
        A higher-order function can accept another function as an argument.

                function higherOrderFunction(callback) {
                    // Do something
                    callback();
                }

                function myCallback() {
                    console.log("Callback executed!");
                }

                higherOrderFunction(myCallback);

    2. Returns a Function:
        A higher-order function can also return a new function.

                function higherOrderFunction() {
                    // Returns a new function
                    return function() {
                        console.log("Returned function executed!");
                    };
                }

                const returnedFunction = higherOrderFunction();
                returnedFunction();

    Common examples of higher-order functions in JavaScript include `map`, `filter`, 
    `reduce`, and `forEach` for array manipulation, as well as functions like 
    `setTimeout` and `addEventListener` for handling asynchronous operations. 

        Example:
                const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

                // Higher-order function: map
                const squaredNumbers = numbers.map(function(num) {
                    return num * num;
                });

                console.log(squaredNumbers); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

Why we use it is because, to make a low level design code, so that the function is reusable,
small & understandable.
___________________________________________________________________________________

9. What is callback?

-> We can take a function and pass it into another function, and when we do so, this 
    function which we pass into another function is known as callback function.
                    As we know Javascript is a synchronous and single-threaded 
    language, but due to callback we can do asynhcronous thing in javascript.

    A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function
    and is executed after the completion of some operation. Callback function are used 
    to handle asynchronous operations, maintain control flow and support functional 
    programming patterns. 

Example:

setTimeout(function () {    // This function that we first pass as a parameter to the setTimeOut 
    console.log("timer");   // is a callback function.
}, 4000);      

function x(y){ 
    console.log("x");
    y();
}
x(function y(){             //  Giving the responsibility of this function to another function.  
    console.log("y");
})

Output: x y timer(after 4sec)
___________________________________________________________________________________

10. What is closure?

-> A function along with a reference to it's outer environment, together forms a 
    closure. In other words, closure is a combination of a function and its lexical 
    scope bundled together forms a closure.

    Closure can be used to create reusable function that can access data which is not 
    in their own scope. 
___________________________________________________________________________________

11. What is promise? Write a code for promise.

-> A promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion or 
    failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It is a way to handle 
    asynchronous operations more elegantly and avoid the callback hell, making code 
    more readable and maintainable.
    
    A Promise is in one of three states:
    1.  Pending: The initial state; neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    2.  Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and the Promise has a 
        resulting value.
    3.  Rejected: The operation failed, and the Promise has a reason for the failure.

A Promise is said to be "settled" if it is either fulfilled or rejected.

Code Example:

            const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            setTimeout(() => {
                resolve("Promise resolved");
            }, 1000);
            });

            myPromise.then((message) => {
            console.log(message);
            }).catch((error) => {
            console.log(error);
            });

Intuition: Think of a Promise as a contract between two parties. One party promises 
to deliver a result in the future (resolve) or provide a reason why they 
couldn't (reject). The other party can then decide what to do based on whether the 
promise was fulfilled or rejected.

12. What are non-primitive data type?

-> Non-primitive data types, also known as reference types, are data types in 
    programming languages that are not directly represented as a single, simple value. 

    Example:
    objects, array, functions, etc...
___________________________________________________________________________________

13. What is `addEventListner`?

->  `addEventListener` is a method in JavaScript that allows us to attach an event 
    handler function to an HTML element. An event handler is a function that gets 
    executed in response to a specific event occurring on an HTML element, such as a 
    click, mouseover, keypress, etc.

    Example:
    element.addEventListener(event, function, options);
___________________________________________________________________________________

14. What is event bubbling?

-> In event bubbling, the event starts at the target element and then moves up the DOM 
    tree, notifying each ancestor element of the event. This is the default behaviour 
    in Javascript.
                In event bubbling, the child tells its parents, who tells their parents
    (i,e. grandparents) and so on.

    Example:
    html:
            <div id="outer">
                <div id="middle">
                   <button id="inner">Click me</button>
                </div>
            </div>

    Example of handling an event during the bubbling phase:
    JavaScript:
            document.getElementById('outer').addEventListener('click', function() {
                console.log('Outer div clicked');
            });

            document.getElementById('middle').addEventListener('click', function() {
                console.log('Middle div clicked');
            });

            document.getElementById('inner').addEventListener('click', function() {
                console.log('Button clicked');
            });
___________________________________________________________________________________

15. What is event delegation, and why is it useful in JavaScript? Provide an example.

-> Event delegation is a JavaScript programming pattern where we use a single event 
    listener to manage all the events for a particular type on a parent element, 
    rather than setting up individual event listeners on each child element. This is 
    achieved by taking advantage of event bubbling, where events on nested elements 
    propagate up to their ancestors.

    imp:- to create cleaner code and fewer event listeners with better logic.

Event delegation is useful for the following reasons:
    1. Efficiency: It reduces the number of event listeners in our code, which can 
        improve performance, especially when dealing with a large number of elements.

    2. Dynamic Content: It works well with dynamically added or removed elements, 
        as the event listener is attached to a parent that exists when the page loads.

    3. Simpler Code: It often leads to cleaner and more maintainable code since we 
        don't need to manage individual event listeners for each child element.

    Example:
            <ul id="itemList">
                <li>Item 1</li>
                <li>Item 2</li>
                <li>Item 3</li>
            </ul>

            <script>
                // Event delegation
                document.getElementById('itemList').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
                    if (event.target.tagName === 'LI') {
                        // The clicked element is an <li> element
                        console.log('Clicked on:', event.target.textContent);
                    }
                });
            </script>
___________________________________________________________________________________

16. What are Async operations ?

-> Async operations in JavaScript refer to operations that are asynchronous, meaning 
    they don't block the execution of the program while waiting for a particular 
    task to complete. Asynchronous operations are crucial for handling tasks that 
    may take some time to finish, such as fetching data from a server, reading a 
    file, or waiting for user input.

    Key concepts related to async operations in JavaScript include:
    --Callback Functions, Promises, Async/Await, etc... 
___________________________________________________________________________________ 

17. What is a JavaScript prototype, and how does it relate to inheritance in JavaScript? 

-> In JavaScript, each object has a prototype, and the prototype is an object itself. 
    The prototype is used for inheritance, allowing one object to inherit properties 
    and methods from another object. 
___________________________________________________________________________________

18. How do you handle cross-origin requests in JavaScript, and what is the Same-Origin Policy?

-> Cross-Origin Requests:-
    Cross-Origin Requests occur when a web page makes a request for a resource from a 
    domain (origin) different from the one that served the web page. Browsers, by default, 
    follow the Same-Origin Policy, a security measure designed to prevent potentially 
    harmful interactions between different origins.

    To handle cross-origin requests, developers often use techniques like:
    1. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):
    2. JSONP (JSON with Padding):
    3. Proxy Server:

   Same-Origin Policy (SOP):-
    The Same-Origin Policy restricts web pages from making requests to a different 
    domain than the one that served the web page. It applies to requests made via 
    JavaScript, and it includes restrictions on accessing certain properties and methods 
    of cross-origin resources.

19. Describe the differences between a shallow copy and a deep copy of objects and 
    arrays in JavaScript.

-> In JavaScript, the concepts of shallow copy and deep copy refer to how objects and 
    arrays are duplicated. Understanding the differences between them is essential 
    for avoiding unexpected behavior when working with complex data structures.

Shallow Copy:
    Definition: A shallow copy creates a new object or array and copies the top-level 
        structure of the original object or array. However, the nested objects or 
        arrays within the original object are still referenced in the copied object.
    Copying Mechanism: Shallow copy is typically achieved using methods like `Object.assign()`, 
        the spread (`...`) operator, or array methods like `slice()`.

    Example of Shallow Copy:
                const originalArray = [1, 2, [3, 4]];
                const shallowCopyArray = [...originalArray];

                shallowCopyArray[2][0] = 99;

                console.log(originalArray);      // Output: [1, 2, [99, 4]]
                console.log(shallowCopyArray);   // Output: [1, 2, [99, 4]]

Deep Copy:
    Definition: A deep copy creates a completely independent copy of the original 
        object or array along with all nested objects or arrays. Changes made to the 
        deep copy do not affect the original object or any of its nested structures.
    Copying Mechanism: Achieving a deep copy is more complex and often requires a   
        custom recursive function or a library like `lodash`.

    Example of Deep Copy:
                const originalArray = [1, 2, [3, 4]];
                const deepCopyArray = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalArray));

                deepCopyArray[2][0] = 99;

                console.log(originalArray);    // Output: [1, 2, [3, 4]]
                console.log(deepCopyArray);    // Output: [1, 2, [99, 4]]

    Difference:-
    Shallow copies are simpler to create and may be sufficient for some use cases.

                But, Deep copies ensure complete independence but can be less efficient 
    and may have limitations, especially with objects containing functions 
    or non-JSON-safe values.When using deep copies, be cautious about circular 
    references, as they may lead to infinite recursion.

            // Display the API response in the console
            console.log(data);
        })
        .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

22. Event Loop:- Event Loop is a continuous process that handles the execution of code, 
    ensuring that tasks are processed efficiently in a non-blocking and asynchronous way. 
                    It is a critical part of JavaScript's concurrency model and is 
    responsible for managing tasks such as handling user interactions, making network 
    requests, and processing events.
___________________________________________________________________________________

23. How does the JavaScript event loop work, and what is the role of the call stack, 
callback queue, and microtask queue?

-> The JavaScript event loop is a crucial mechanism that handles asynchronous operations 
    in the language. Here's a brief explanation of how it works, including the roles of 
    the call stack, callback queue, and microtask queue:

1. Call Stack:
    The call stack is a data structure that records where in the program we are. It keeps 
    track of function calls. When a function is invoked, it's added to the top of the stack.
    When a function completes, it's removed from the stack.

2. Callback Queue (Task Queue):
    The callback queue, also known as the task queue, holds messages (functions) to be 
    processed. These messages are added to the queue when an asynchronous operation 
    completes or when an event occurs.

3. Microtask Queue:
    The microtask queue holds tasks that are higher-priority than the regular callback 
    queue tasks. Microtasks are usually used for promises and mutation observer callbacks.

4. MutationObserver:
    The MutationObserver interface provides the ability to watch for changes being made to 
    the DOM tree. It is designed as a replacement for the older Mutation Events feature, 
    which was part of the DOM3 Events specification.

    ### Event Loop Process: ###

1. Execute Synchronous Code:
    The JavaScript engine starts by executing any synchronous code it finds. Functions are 
    added to the call stack and executed in a first-in, last-out order.

2. Handle Asynchronous Operations:
    When an asynchronous operation (e.g., a setTimeout, AJAX request, or event listener) 
    is encountered, it's offloaded to the browser's APIs, and the engine continues executing 
    the remaining synchronous code.

3. Callback Queue and Microtask Queue:
    When an asynchronous operation completes or an event occurs, a callback (function) is 
    added to the callback queue or microtask queue, depending on the type of task.

4. Event Loop:
    The event loop continually checks the call stack. If it's empty, it takes the first 
    task from the microtask queue and moves it to the call stack. Microtasks are given 
    priority and are processed before regular tasks.

5. Repeat:
    The process repeats, with the event loop continuously checking the call stack and 
    moving tasks from the callback queue or microtask queue to the call stack as needed.

Example:
                console.log('Start');

                setTimeout(function() {
                console.log('Timeout callback');
                }, 0);

                Promise.resolve().then(function() {
                console.log('Promise resolved');
                });

                console.log('End');

Output:
                Start
                End
                Promise resolved
                Timeout callback

The JavaScript event loop ensures that asynchronous operations are handled efficiently, 
with the call stack, callback queue, and microtask queue working together to manage the 
flow of code execution. The event loop continuously checks for available tasks, 
prioritizing microtasks over regular tasks, and ensures that the program remains 
responsive and non-blocking.
