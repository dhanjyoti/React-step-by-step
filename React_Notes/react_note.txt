React-
ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building
user interfaces. It is an open-source, component-based front-end library that is 
responsible only for the view layer of the application. ReactJS is not a framework, 
it is just a library developed by Facebook to solve some problems that we were 
facing earlier.

                    Chapter 1 - Why React?

Advantages/Characteristics-
1. Component-Based Architecture:
- React promotes a modular and component-based architecture, where you can break 
down your user interface into small, reusable pieces called components.
- This modularity improves code organization, reusability, and maintainability, 
making it easier to build and maintain complex applications.

2. Virtual DOM(Document Object Model):
- React introduces a Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. 
It allows React to efficiently update and render changes to the user interface.
- By minimizing direct interactions with the actual DOM, React significantly 
improves performance, leading to faster and more responsive applications.

3. Declarative Syntex:
- React uses a declarative syntax, meaning you describe what you want the 
UI to look like, and React takes care of updating the UI to match that description.
- This leads to more predictable and easier-to-understand code compared to 
imperative approaches.

4. Efficient Updates:
- React efficiently updates only the parts of the UI that have changed, thanks
 to its reconciliation algorithm and the Virtual DOM.
- This reduces unnecessary re-renders and improves application performance.

5. Larger Ecosystem and Community: 
- React has a vast ecosystem of libraries, tools, and extensions, making it easy 
to integrate with other technologies and solve various development challenges.
- A large and active community provides extensive support, resources, and documentation
 for developers.

6. One-Way Data Flow:
- React enforces a one-way data flow, which simplifies debugging and helps prevent 
common data-related bugs by ensuring that data flows in a single direction.
- This pattern improves code predictability and maintainability.

7. Server-Side Rendering(SSR) and Isomorphic Apps:
- React supports server-side rendering, allowing you to render components on the server
 and send pre-rendered HTML to the client.
- This benefits SEO, performance, and user experience, especially for single-page 
applications (SPAs).

8. React Native for Mobile Development:
- React Native extends the React paradigm to mobile app development, enabling you to use
 the same skills and codebase to build native iOS and Android applications.
- This leads to faster development and code sharing between web and mobile platforms.

9. Strong Developer Tools:
- React comes with a set of developer tools (e.g., React DevTools) that make it easier to 
inspect and debug React applications.
- These tools help developers identify performance bottlenecks and track component behavior.

10. Community and Industry Adoption:
- React has gained widespread popularity and is used by many large companies and
 organizations, ensuring its long-term viability and industry support.

* To start React we use `npx create-react-app app-name`
npx - to run package.json script
create-react-app - toolchain
app-name - name of our react file

* index.html inside the public folder is the Single-Page-Application

# Assignment 1:
If we delete node_modules. How to run our app again successfully ?

Open Your Terminal/Command Prompt:
Open the terminal or command prompt on your computer.

Navigate to Your React Project Directory:
Use the cd (change directory) command to navigate to the root directory of your React project.
1. cd path/to/your/react/project

Initialize a New package.json File:
If you don't have a package.json file already, you can create one using the following command:
2. npm init -y

Install Dependencies:
Use the npm install command to reinstall all the dependencies listed in your package.json file.
 Since you deleted the node_modules folder, you need to reinstall the dependencies:
3. npm install

Start Your React App:
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start your React app as usual:
4. npm start

                    Chapter 2 - Components

In React, components are the functional building blocks of a user interface(UI). They 
encapsulate a piece of the UI's functionality and appearance, allowing you to create modular,
reusable, and maintainable code. Components are like reusable custom HTML elements with their
own behaviour and styling.

* Function is used as a Tag in React
* Always use Camel Case in JSX

1. Fragment -> In React, a fragment is a way to group multiple children elements without adding
 an extra DOM element to the rendered output. Fragments are a lightweight and efficient way 
 to structure your component's JSX code, especially when you need to return adjacent JSX elements
 without a parent wrapper.

2. JSX -> 
JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension of JavaScript used in React for defining the structure and
 content of user interfaces. It provides a more concise and readable way to describe the structure 
 of UI components compared to manually creating DOM elements with JavaScript functions.
                                    JSX resembles HTML but is actually a syntax extension for JavaScript. It allows you to write
 HTML-like code within your JavaScript files. 

                    Chapter 3 - Conditional Rendering
                    
Conditional rendering in React allows you to display different content or components
 based on certain conditions or criteria. You can use JavaScript expressions or
  conditional statements to determine what should be rendered in your React components.
   Here are some common patterns for conditional rendering in React:
1. Using Ternary Operators:

function App({ isLoggedIn }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn ? (
        <p>Welcome, User!</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Please log in to continue.</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
In this example, the isLoggedIn prop is used to conditionally render a welcome message or
 a login prompt.

2. Using Logical && Operator:

Note:: This method should not be used in case of Numbers as it might mis-identify the
result with `0` and `1`.

function App({ isLoading }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {!isLoading && <p>Content Loaded</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
Here, the isLoading prop is used to conditionally render a loading message. 
If isLoading is true, the loading message is displayed; otherwise, the content is displayed.

3. Using Conditional Statements:

function App({ isMobile }) {
  if (isMobile) {
    return <p>This is a mobile device.</p>;
  } else {
    return <p>This is not a mobile device.</p>;
  }
}
In this case, the isMobile prop is used to determine which message to render using 
a traditional if-else statement.

4. Using a Function:
We can create a separate function to handle conditional rendering:

function Message({ isMorning }) {
  function getMessage() {
    if (isMorning) {
      return <p>Good morning!</p>;
    } else {
      return <p>Good evening!</p>;
    }
  }

  return <div>{getMessage()}</div>;
}
In this example, the getMessage function is responsible for determining the message based
 on the isMorning prop.

5. Using the Map Function:
If you have an array of items to render conditionally, you can use the map function to 
render them based on a condition:

function List({ items }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{item.isCompleted ? 'Done' : 'Not Done'}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
In this example, each item in the items array is rendered conditionally based on its
 isCompleted property.


`Key` -> In React, a key is a special attribute that you can include when rendering a list
 of elements, such as an array of components or DOM elements. The key is used by React to 
 help it identify each element in the list uniquely and efficiently update the list when 
 changes occur. Keys are essential for optimizing the rendering performance and behavior of 
 lists in React.

Here are some key points to understand about keys in React:

Uniqueness: Keys must be unique among the siblings of the same parent. In other words, 
within a list of elements, each key should be different.

Stability: React expects keys to be stable across re-renders. This means that the key of 
an element should not change between renders, especially if the element retains its position 
in the list.

Performance: Keys help React identify which elements have changed, been added, or been removed 
in a list. This allows React to update the DOM efficiently by reusing existing elements and 
minimizing re-rendering.

Reconciliation: React uses keys to perform a process called "reconciliation," which determines 
how to update the UI when the underlying data changes. Keys help React maintain a mapping 
between the elements in the virtual DOM and their corresponding elements in the real DOM.
