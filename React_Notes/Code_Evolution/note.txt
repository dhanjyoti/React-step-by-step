What is React?
-> React is an open source library for building user interfaces.
2 key points - 1. It is a javascript library. Not a Framework.
               2. Building user interfaces.

Why learn React?
-> It is project created and maintained by facebook.
It has a huge community.

Component Based Architecture -
-> It helps us break down our application into small encapsulated 
part and which can then be composed to make more complex UI's.

React is Declarative -
-> Tell React what we want and React will build the actual UI.
React will handle efficiently updating and rendering of the components.
DOM updates are handles gracefully in React.

What is npx?
-> It is npm package runner. It gets installed when we install node.

Components -
-> Components describe a part of the user interface.
They are re-usable and can be used nested inside other components.
Components are the building blogs of any React application.
2 types - Stateless Functional Components
        - Stateful Class Components

Functional Component vs Class Component
Functional->
- Simple functions receiving props and returning a declaration.
- advantage is absence of `this` keyword.
- solution without using state.
- Mainly responsible for the UI.
- also known as stateless/dumb/presentational Components,
but after introduction of hooks it became stateful again.

Class->
- More feature rich
- maintain their own private data - state
- Complex UI logic
- Provide lifecycle hooks
- also known as stateful/smart/container Components

JSX
-> Javascript XML(JSX) - Extension to the Javascript syntax.
Write XML - like code in React for elements and components.
JSX tags have a tag name, attributes and children.
JSX makes React code simpler and elegant.
JSX ultimately transpiles to pure Javascript which is
understood by the browsers.

In JSX `props` are immutable, it means they cannot be changed.

props vs state
props->
- props get passed to the component
- Function parameters
- props are immutable


state->
- state is managed within the component
- Variables declared in the function body
- state can be changed
