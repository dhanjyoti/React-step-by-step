1. Data Structures
-> Data Structures is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
                A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them
    and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data.

2. Array
-> An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, where each element can be 
    accessed by its index or position within the array. Arrays are used to organize and manage 
    data efficiently, allowing for easy storage, retrieval, and manipulation of elements.

3. String
-> A string is a data type used in programming to represent a sequence of characters. In most 
    programming languages, strings are used to store text, such as words, sentences, 
    or even entire documents.

4. Variable
-> A variable is a named storage location that holds a value, which can be changed or modified 
    during the execution of a program. Variables are used to store and manipulate data, 
    making it easier to work with values in a program.

5. Operstors
-> Operators are symbols or keywords that perform specific operations on operands (values or variables). 
    Operators are used to manipulate data, perform calculations, compare values, and control 
    the flow of execution in a program.

6. Hashing
-> Hashing, also known as hash mapping, is a technique used in computer science to efficiently 
    map keys to values. It involves applying a hash function to a key to generate a hash code, 
    which is then used to index and retrieve data in a data structure called a hash table or hash map.

7. Linked List
-> A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements, called nodes, 
    where each node contains both data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. 
    Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size and dynamically allocate memory for
    each node as needed.

8. Sorting
-> Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a collection (such as an array or a list) 
    in a particular order, typically in ascending or descending order based on some key or 
    comparison criteria. Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science and is used 
    in various applications to organize and retrieve data efficiently.

9. Queue
-> A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, 
    meaning that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. It resembles 
    a real-world queue or line, where people are served in the order they arrive.

10. Stack
-> A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, 
    meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. It resembles 
    a stack of plates, where the last plate added is the first one to be removed.

11. Linear Searching
-> Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a straight forward searching algorithm that 
    checks each element in a collection (such as an array or a list) one by one until the target 
    element is found or the end of the collection is reached. It sequentially compares the target 
    value with each element in the collection until a match is found.

12. Binary Searching
-> Binary search is a highly efficient searching algorithm used to find a specific element in a 
    sorted collection (such as an array) by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. 
    It is based on the principle of divide and conquer, which allows it to achieve 
    logarithmic time complexity.

13. Difference/comparison between Array and Array List
-> A concise comparison between arrays and array lists:

    Definition:
        Arrays: Fixed-size, contiguous memory structure.
        ArrayLists: Dynamic-size list implementation using arrays.

    Size:
        Arrays: Fixed size, determined at declaration.
        ArrayLists: Dynamic size, can grow or shrink.

    Resizing:
        Arrays: Cannot resize after declaration.
        ArrayLists: Resize automatically when needed.

    Type Safety:
        Arrays: Not type-safe, can store mixed types.
        ArrayLists: Type-safe, stores elements of a specific type.

    Performance:
        Arrays: Better for random access, slower resizing.
        ArrayLists: Efficient for dynamic resizing and operations.

    Flexibility:
        Arrays: Less flexible, fixed size.
        ArrayLists: More flexible, dynamic size.

14. Continue
-> `Continue` is a keyword used within loops (such as for loops, while loops, and do-while loops) 
    to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. When encountered, 
    the `continue` statement immediately jumps to the next iteration of the loop, bypassing any 
    remaining code within the current iteration.

15. Object
-> An object is an unordered collction of key-value pairs. The key must either be a string or
    symbol data type. Whereas the value can be of any data type.
                To retrieve a value, we can use the corresponding key. This can be achieved using 
    the dot notation or bracket notation.
                An object is not an iterable. We cannot use it with a `for of` loop.
