/*
    Array-> Array is used to store multiple values in a single variable
    in a continuous manner.
                An array is a fundamental data structure used in computer programming 
        and consists of a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. 
        These elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, which means they are 
        placed one after the other in memory.
                Arrays can hold elements of the same data type, and the size of an array 
        is typically fixed when it is created. This data structure is essential for 
        storing and managing collections of data, such as lists of numbers, characters, 
        or objects, making it a crucial tool for a wide range of programming tasks.

    String-> A string in programming is a collection of characters used to represent 
    text or data. It's fundamental for tasks like text processing, input/output, 
    and data manipulation.

    Variables-> Variables in programming are containers for storing data or values. 
    Eg: String, int, float, char, boolean, etc. They have a name, a data type, and can 
    be changed during execution. Variables are fundamental for manipulating and storing 
    information in a program.

    Operators-> Operators in programming are symbols or keywords used to perform 
    operations on data, such as addition, comparison, or manipulation. They are
    essential for computations and decision-making in code. Operators include arithmetic,
    comparison and logical operators, among others.
